      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <h3>Opposition Research</h3>
      <p> Every year I play against my 9 high school friends to determine draft order in our fantasy football league. I always win. This year however, the challenge is much more daunting: I'm competing against 50 of my MBA cohort, a very competitive group and most importantly, I don't know them as closely as my high school friends. Knowing how my friends would pick was what gave me the competitive edge. For example, I picked UVA to win the national title last year because I knew that my friends would not pick them. Specifically, the two people that typically come in 2nd and 3rd in these brackets had picked UVA as champions the previous year when they lost in the 1st round to UMBC. That image had to be fresh in their brains. Also, 30% of the league are Cal alum and ALWAYS pick them to win the first couple of rounds. Therefore, I pick against Cal in the early rounds and have a good chance at picking up points. This opposition research will be difficult to employ now that there are 40 more people to analyze. However, there are a couple of things that work in my favor, even at scale. For one, I am attending CU Boulder and I can be pretty sure that a majority of the cohort will take Colorado two rounds. I don't think they are that good based on watching them in the Pac 12 tournament. That's why I will be taking Florida State in the round of 32 and give myself a good chance to get a leg-up. If you are not in a pool but rather competing against large amounts of people, say in a public espn group, you can still use psychology and game theory to your advantage. Look at the People's bracket on ESPN and keep an eye out for big name school that are not as good as the people's bracket would indicate (ie Syracuse). There is a reason I discuss strategy first: Strategy is more important than knowledge! If knowledge was the main factor driving bracket success, Jay Bilas would win his pool every year. Yet this is clearly not the case...
        <h3>Value Picks</h3>
        <p>Take a lot at the South Region: Ohio State is the 2 seed and Baylor is the 1 seed so I'm pretty sure over 50% of entrants will have one of those two teams in the Final 4. Yet, when we take a closer look Purdue is the best choice if you want to get ahead of the competition. Baylor will have to beat either Wisconsin or UNC, programs with impressive March Resumes. Ohio State will likely have to beat Arkansas (a 3 seed) to even make the elite 8. Now look at Purdue, they likely get a Villanova team without their best player, before facing Baylor/Wisconsin/UNC. Keep in mind that Purdue has beaten Ohio State TWICE this season! Some quick mental math and I'd give Purdue, Ohio State and Baylor an equal chance of making the final 4. If you want to WIN (see "No Feelings Allowed ;)"), Purdue is the pick here because you will move ahead of the field if they win. </p>

        <h3>Momentum</h3>
        <p> I love teams that end the season strong. This year I am keeping an eye on Bama, Oregon State and SDSU among others. </p>

        <h3>Late Rounds Matter WAY more</h3>
        <p> Each game in the round of 64 is worth ten points compared to 160 pts/game in the final four and the 320-point championship game. That is to say, focus on getting the later rounds right and don't sweat the first round. </p>

        <h3> Don't be a Hero!! </h3>
          <p> Let's face it, we do NOT know more than the experts when it comes to college basketball. This was the hardest thing for me to accept, but was also the catalyst for my 3 year bracket winning run! Let me quickly apologize to Jay Bilas, because I rely on his insights to make most of my picks. How do I know about Jason Preston on Ohio or that Purdue beat Ohio State twice this season? ESPN did the work for me! In order to keep pace with your competitors, make the easy smart picks and get ahead in other ways (see opposition research). If you do this alone, you have a great chance of beating the lower 25 percentile of entrants who are making stupid picks because of stupid reasoning. If in doubt go Chalk all the way! From 1985 to 2019, 63% of final 4 teams have been 1-seeds, there is no shame in having four 1-seeds in your final 4
             <h3> No Feelings Allowed </h3>
               <p> This is the tough one... "My school is in the dance for the first time in 10 years, how do I not pick them?" I get it, I'm picking UC Santa Barbara I am a total hypocrite. But... I'm only taking them one round because I want to WIN! "But Pete I want to pick a fun bracket." Take my word for it, the fun bracket is the bracket that WINS your pool! And on that note lets cover some picks that will help you win your bracket.
       <h2>Round of 64</h2>

          <p>
          <strong> <mark> Ohio </mark> over UVA:</strong> </p>
          <p> As much as I would like to reward UVA for winning me my 2019 bracket pool, there is no room for feelings in March (except for Santa Barbara). Ohio nearly beat Illinois in November and has star Jason Preston (16, 7, 7) at guard, the type of player that can carry his team, similar to what Steph did for Davidson. Virginia is solid, but is not going to blow anyone out. I'm comfortable picking this upset because I'm very confident that Gonzaga will beat whichever team makes it to the Sweet 16 </p>

          <p>
         <strong> <mark> Villanova </mark> over Winthrop:</strong> </p>
         <p> This definitely falls under the "Don't be a hero" strategy. Villanova may be hurt, but they are still heavy favorites over Winthrop. They have a better pedigree and have beaten much better teams. So I got physically excited when I saw the 26% of America is picking Winthrop! (Peoples Bracket on ESPN). Take Villanova and get ahead of the lower 25% immediately!


            <p>
           <strong> <mark> San Diego Stae </mark> over Syracuse:</strong> </p>
           <p> It seems to me that 41% of America is picking Syracuse because they are a popular team with a great pedigree. In reality, San Diego State is the much better team. </p>

           <h2>Round of 32</h2>

           <p>
          <strong> <mark>Ohio</mark> over UCSB/Creighton</strong> </p>
          <p> UCSB has not beaten any good teams this year and Creighton is dealing with inappropriate comments from their coach. Ohio's run will continue after upsetting UVA.</p>

          <p>
         <strong> <mark>MSU/UCLA</mark> over Texas</strong> </p>
         <p> 78% of Americans are picking Texas to advance to the Sweet 16 but I'm not sure why. To win the Big 12 Tourney, they beat Texas Tech by 1 point and dodged Kansas due to Covid. That is to say, they are overrated. Take advantage of this perception issue and bank on strong programs of UCLA or Michigan State.</p>

 <h2>Sweet 16</h2>
      <p><strong><mark>Purdue</mark> over Baylor </strong> </p>
      <p> See Value Picks </p>

      <p><strong><mark>Alabama</mark> over Texas/MSU/UCLA </strong> </p>
      <p> Alabama is extremely athletic, enough so that they can still win even if they have a bad shooting game. They have great momentum too, having won a very difficult SEC championship. This is a no-brainer for me, yet 42% of brackets have Texas over Bama. Roll with the tide. </p>

<h2>Elite 8</h2>
<p><strong><mark>Purdue</mark> over Ohio State </strong> </p>
<p> This game is a Toss-up for me and it could just as well be Baylor, Wisconsin or UNC vs Ohio State. Hell it could even be Arkansas instead of Ohio State. This region of the bracket is so competitive, the best move is to go with one of the best teams that is being undervalued, in this case America predicts Purdue to advance to the elite 8 12% of the time. Take advantage of this great opportunity to get ahead of 88% of brackets.  </p>

<h2>Final Four</h2>
<p><strong><mark>Gonzaga</mark> over Michigan </strong> </p>
<p> Don't get cute here. Gonzaga is clearly the best team in the nation. They have three of the best players in the nation and have beaten Kansas, Virginia, Iowa, West Virginia and Auburn. It's always tough to get the Final Four right, but this seems like the best bet to make it.</p>

<h2>Championship</h2>
<p><strong><mark>Purdue</mark> over Gonzaga </strong> </p>
<p> The last time a team completed a perfect season in 1976. The pressure builds up on these record-setting teams and makes it very difficult to win, see 2014-2015 Kentucky Wildcats and 2015-2016 Warriors ;). Purdue has proven that it can beat top teams (Ohio State twice). By picking a non-obvious champion you give yourself the opportunity to top your bracket.</p>
